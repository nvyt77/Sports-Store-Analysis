# Dick's Sporting Goods Power BI Reporting Dashboard

## Introduction

Dick's Sporting Goods stands as a frontrunner in the sporting goods retail industry, offering a comprehensive selection of equipment, apparel, and footwear designed for a variety of outdoor activities and sports enthusiasts. As the company expands its footprint across the United States, gaining in-depth insights into sales performance, customer demographics, product effectiveness, and geographic market dynamics becomes increasingly vital.

To address this critical need, Dick's Sporting Goods has embarked on the development of a sophisticated Power BI reporting dashboard. The objective of this initiative is to create a suite of interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboards that encapsulate essential performance metrics across multiple dimensions. This will empower stakeholders to derive meaningful insights into sales trends, customer behaviors, and product performance, ultimately facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning. Furthermore, we have ensured that the selected dashboard visual includes at least one tooltip, allowing users to hover over specific areas and view detailed sales figures and trends.
